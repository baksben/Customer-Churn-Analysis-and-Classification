# Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Classification
With the rapid development of telecommunication industry, the service providers are inclined more towards expansion of the subscriber base. 
To meet the need of surviving in the competitive environment, the retention of existing customers has become a huge challenge. 
It is stated that the cost of acquiring a new customer is far more than that for retaining the existing one. 
Therefore, it is imperative for the telecom industries to use advanced analytics to understand consumer behavior and in-turn predict the association of the customers
as whether or not they will leave the company.
I was given a dataset: each row represents a customer and each column contains attributes related to customer as described:

Churn (target): 1 if customer cancelled service, 0 if not
AccountWeeks: number of weeks customer has had active account
ContractRenewal: 1 if customer recently renewed contract, 0 if not
DataPlan: 1 if customer has data plan, 0 if not
DataUsage: gigabytes of monthly data usage
CustServCalls: number of calls into customer service
DayMins: average daytime minutes per month
DayCalls: average number of daytime calls
MonthlyCharge: average monthly bill
OverageFee: largest overage fee in last 12 months
RoamMins: average number of roaming minutes
I was asked to develop an algorithm to be able to assess which are the customers that have the highest probability to churn, and answer the 3 following questions:

What variables are contributing to customer churn?
Who are the customers more likely to churn?
What actions can be taken to stop them from leaving?
